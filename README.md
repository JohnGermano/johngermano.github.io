## My Personal Website

This is my personal website using a template from [HTML5up](https://html5up.net/). It's meant to serve as the following:

1. A personal website that I can update as needed
2. Aid in my exploration of HTML, CSS, and Javascript as I have little experience in these languages

Feel free to explore around and contact me with any questions!
